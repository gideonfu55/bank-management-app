Bank Account Management app

This was a good exercise for practicing OOP, TDD and handling lists in Java. Useful lessons I've learnt:

1. Write meaningful tests cases before functions to ensure that the requirements are satisfied.
2. First plan on the relationship between objects - what are inherited from parent classes and what classes have unique behavior. Do not repeat code on methods that are shared by all classes.
3. Understand how streams and loops in lists are used in handling a large amount of data.
